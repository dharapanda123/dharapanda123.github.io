Subtitle:My Thoughts

Date 08/12/2014

When I first entered the world of EDA i was very very scared.Doubted myself all the time.
I was not sure if i could do it.And thought everybody in the cohort is in a better place than where i am.
felt silly sometimes.but one thing was sure,i quickly realised how my life is going to change.


My impression of EDA is very positive.After my break of 5 years i felt like i never worked before.
And busy enjoying my life lost touch with the otherside of the world.
When i decided to learn c#,my focus was to learn and become an amazing developer.
because jobs will follow.so wasnt really worried about that.
I wanted the confidence as a developer so as to face the job world with an attitude(a good one)
I honestly feel EdA will direct me in the way of gaining knowledge and confidence.
And that makes me very eager through this process,no matter hpw impossible it seemed.

In the beginning i weas embarrassed by the feeling of being the silliest in the cohort,and about being left alone in the dark.
As i am getting to understand the culture i realise everybody here is to learn.
Everybody has some sense of insecurity and everybody here wants to help each other in everyway possible.
So i dont really have to bother about what somebody thinks of me,but just keep learning more and more and more.so i am loving this culture.

Yes. My expectation Of EDA has definitely changed,only in the positive way.

I am super excited and duper nervous to be part of this kind of learning process.

I cant wait to see what happens to my brain after the bootcamp.And how i change my little world for better.
