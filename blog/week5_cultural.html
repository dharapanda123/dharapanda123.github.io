          <li>I have worked thrice in pair till now.</li>
          <li>worked with Steven,then in GPS worked with Julian and worked with Ashley recently at EDA.</li>
          <li>Interestingly for me all three were quite different experience.When I worked with Steven it was very new for me and Steven helped a lot.</li>
          <li>Then in GPS in presence of Patrick realised we could be stuck on a very minor problem for a long time unless we time box</li>
          <li>The third time was at EDA,with Ashley for the pad-array challenge.And working in person felt good   </li>

        The Pairing was mostly Fun.But the Frustrating Part of it was that I felt I am being less helpful then I could be.And the difficult part was that 
        although I knew preparing ahead would help,had no time to do that.

        Felt good to read the feedback.The Feedback I received was really helpful.As i mentioned above would try to do a bit of prep before jumping into a challenge.It was good to write a feedback.It was not difficult but a bit confusing to write a feedback as it was the first time i did so.
