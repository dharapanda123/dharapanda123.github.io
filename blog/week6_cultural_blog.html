  <p>What is stereotype threat:</p>I understand stereotype threat being the" fear of confirming a negetive idea about a group we belong to".
  <p>Its a topic that everybody can relate to.And each of us has experienced it and continue to.</p>
  <p>When I see the question "Describe your experiences with stereotype threat and how it affected you.",its funny.because after understanding i would love to share a few things which are very appropriate for my experience(with stereotype) being an INDIAN.</p>
  <p>Women should not go sporty:</p>Women climbing tree or ladder, women running, women loving adventure; all these falls under the category of ‘no-no’ for women as a part of gender stereotypes in India.

  And Thanks to my parents who always encouraged us not to believe in this stereotype and I was a sprint runner throgh out my school career.

  <p>Women should not raise voice: Probably this is one of the gender stereotypes in India, which still exists. Talking or laughing out loud is considered as a bad manner for women, while it has to do nothing with men.</p>
  <p>Marriage is parent’s decision: Nowadays, girls have a voice in expressing their feelings and opinions. But, still gender stereotypes in India focus more on a concept that marriage is all about the decision of parents.

  	<p>No matter if we are working ,at home, A mother, A wife,A student everywhere we have a chanmce of feeling stereotyped and get stressed.
  		I believe if we are aware of "Ourselves" and  understanding the "situation" where we are could help us not getting too stressed and not feeling  The stereotype threat.</p>
  		<p>Keeping in mind the positives of the group you belong would help rather than thinking the negetives.</p>
