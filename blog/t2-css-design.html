Margin
The margin clears an area around an element (outside the border). The margin does not have a background color, and is completely transparent.

The top, right, bottom, and left margin can be changed independently using separate properties. A shorthand margin property can also be used, to change all margins at once.

CSS Margins are nearly identical to the CSS Padding attribute except for one important difference: a margin defines the white space around an HTML element's border, while padding refers to the white space within the border. Setting the actual value of margin is just the same as with padding, so you can probably zip right through this lesson.

Possible Values
Value Description
auto : The browser calculates a margin
length : Specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc. Default value is 0px
% :Specifies a margin in percent of the width of the containing element
inherit: Specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element

In CSS, it is possible to specify different margins for different sides of an element:
Example

p {
    margin-top: 100px;
    margin-bottom: 100px;
    margin-right: 150px;
    margin-left: 50px;
}
Margin - Shorthand property
To shorten the code, it is possible to specify all the margin properties in one property. This is called a shorthand property.

The shorthand property for all the margin properties is "margin":

Example

p {
    margin: 100px 50px;
}
Border:
The CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, size, and color of an element's border.
 Before CSS, borders were basically limited to those things that actually had a border to begin with: tables, frames, and Russian break-away republics....
     Now you can set borders to just about any HTML element. Most likely you will be surrounding blocks of text and images. Past that, everything else seems kind of silly. A border around an HR line? Why? I can't imagine, but I know someone will do it. So, here we go.
     you won't have to write out each command each time. Just use "border:" and list the attributes. Here's an example using a block of text:
