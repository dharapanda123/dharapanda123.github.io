  <p>When I researched about the "Problems facing the tech world",the first thing caught my attention was "complexity".When I read Steven's Blog it was pretty good and was about the  topic. So i decided to look for something else. The next topic that caught Attention was"obsolescence".</p>
  <p>Everything from the PC we are using to the skills needed to perform the job seem to become obsolete in three to five years. As costs continue to be scrutinized, IT needs to find a way to reduce the costs of obsolescence. Obsolescence poses another problem: Which development software will still be around 10 years from now? Pick the wrong horse and you may be faced with the same challenge to support it with a lot of extra cost.</p> 
  <p>Perform Proactive Obsolescence Management</p>

  <p> Obsolescence Management is recognised as an intrinsic part of the Logistic Support planning process and it is imperative to address obsolescence risk early within the project Through Life Management Planning cycle.  The deployment of a proactive Obsolescence Management framework as a systems engineering discipline will help you to achieve the best availability at the optimum cost of ownership through integration of the obsolescence support solution with product design or selection.</p>
