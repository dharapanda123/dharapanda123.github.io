        As I know that i have  a CONCRETE SEQUENTIAL style of thinking ,i keep asking myself how to use this to maximise
        my learning at EDA.Because i believe although its not impossible to change the style its quite unnatural to happen.
        So instead of changing the style of learning i would rathe find a way to work aroun it so that i can achieve "MY BEST"
        After some research on that i found its quite possible and every style has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>

       <div id="set">

        Concrete  Sequential Learners work best when they

      <p id="para">As far as the mindsets go, i learned in the second week into the phase 0 at EDA that i have to care less about what people think of me and concentrate on how i can learn the maximum.I am not afraid of making mistakes or asking for help about anything,but sure want to be the best what i can be.After that i am noticing a change in my grasping.i might be slow compared to others ,but thats no camparision.i Just have to keep studying untill i get it.That boosts my confidence.I think i am definitely thinking in a broader way than i used to.And hoping to get better 1 inch everyday.</p>
